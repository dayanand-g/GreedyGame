I successfully completed the assignment which was assigned to me, As the pdf mentioned I developed a frontend in Reactjs with redux and I hopefully followed the essential points inside the project as pdf mentioned in the above assignment.

Solution is hosted in "Vercel"  (  https://greedy-games-pi.vercel.app/analytics  ).

I hope that the completed assignment meets your expectations. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
